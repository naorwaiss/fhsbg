I'm developing an image processing system that locks onto a red object with some conditions.
1. Information must be collected for each red body that is in the image continuously for 3 seconds or more and also mark it with a blue square.
2. Among the marked bodies, choose the body with the largest dimensions and take out its center of gravity and mark its frame in green
